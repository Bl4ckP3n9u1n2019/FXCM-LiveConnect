# FXCM-LiveConnect
FXCM API to use live ticker data

A working file in progress that will continue to be updated - see remarks.
This will be combined with a ML prediction BUY/SELL trading agent to execute trades.
Final version will either grab historical ticker data or from when the connection is made, wait until there is enough data for the ML predictor to calculate and start trading.
Possibibly the ticker data will be saved to a CSV file and newer ticker data will be added to this file.
Auto timer and manual stop will be added.
